# Code-Sample
This is a small code sample and accompanying report that was used for my final project **BAIS:6100 Text Analytics** at the University of Iowa. The class foused on simple natural language processing techniques used for data cleaning, regex patterns, document vectorization, TF-IDF matrices, sentiment analysis, and topic modelling. The final project was an open-ended invitation to find a messy, real-world dataset, and apply some of the techniques taught in the course.

The report included in this repository was submitted along with the code, and can be used for more information about my goals for this project. The source of the dataset comes from the paper cited below. You can read the paper and learn more about the creation of the dataset [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26433122/ ). The supplementary materials for this paper include some notes on how to parse and clean this data, though I opted to clean the data myself in order to practice these techniques.

This is meant to serve as a readable example of my code and report-writing, I cannot promise that the code will be reproducible on your own.
